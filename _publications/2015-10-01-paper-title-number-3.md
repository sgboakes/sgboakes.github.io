excerpt: 'In recent years, with the success of large constellation networks like Starlink and OneWeb, the number of satellites launched into low Earth orbit (LEO) has increased dramatically. With limited ground-based resources, maintaining effective space situational awareness (SSA) becomes an increasing problem-with the task of assigning sensors to observe targets being potentially combinatorially complex. In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has been successfully applied to a range of problems, including assignment problems such as SSA. In this paper, we present a set of RL environments for tracking satellites in different SSA scenarios. We outline methods for tracking a set of known targets, and for searching for targets in the field of regard. RL is well suited for any orbital paradigm, and in this paper we focus specifically on Earth-based sensors that can make measurements of LEO satellites. These environments are evaluated using different RL algorithms that produce sensor tasking policies, and their performance is measured.'
