excerpt: 'This paper announces version 1.0 of Stone Soup: the open-source tracking and state estimation framework. We highlight key elements of the framework and outline example applications and community activities. Stone Soup is engineered with modularity and encapsulation at its heart. This means that its many components can be put together in any number of ways to build, compare, and assure almost any type of multi-target tracking and fusion algorithm. Since its inception in 2017, it has aimed to provide the target tracking and state estimation community with an open, easy-to-deploy framework to develop and assess the performance of different types of trackers. Now, through repeated application in many use cases, implementation of a wide variety of algorithms, multiple beta releases, and contributions from the community, the framework has reached a stable point. In announcing this release, we hope to encourage additional adoption and further contributions to the toolkit. We also acknowledge and express appreciation for the many contributions of time and expertise donated by the tracking and fusion community.'
